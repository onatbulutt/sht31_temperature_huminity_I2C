# sht31_temperature_huminity_I2C
 This project involves reading temperature and humidity data from a sensor using I2C communication and displaying the values on a 7-segment display using an STM32 microcontroller.

#Overview
This project reads temperature and humidity data from a sensor via I2C and displays the results on a 7-segment display. It is designed for use with STM32 microcontrollers and utilizes the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library.

#Features
I2C communication with a temperature and humidity sensor.
Display of temperature and humidity on a 7-segment display.
Simple and modular code structure.

#Hardware Requirements
STM32 microcontroller (e.g., STM32F103)
Temperature and humidity sensor (SHT31)
7-segment display
Breadboard and jumper wires for prototyping

#Software Requirements
STM32CubeIDE or any compatible IDE for STM32 development

#Installation
